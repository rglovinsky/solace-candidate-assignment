# Potential Improvements for the Repository

If more time were available, the following enhancements could be considered:

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**:

- Add a detailed `README.md` with setup instructions, usage examples, and project goals.
- Include API documentation if applicable.

2. **Testing**:

- Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing.

3. **More Frontend Improvements**:

- More interactions and better filtering could be added to the frontend.
  - Sorting of advocates or specific filters would probably be better than only raw text search.
- Styling could be improved for better user experience.

4. **Backend Improvements**:

- Implement a more robust database solution for storing and querying data.
  - I looked into tsvector and trigrams but ran out of time to implement them.
- Add caching mechanisms to improve performance.
